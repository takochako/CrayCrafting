CrayCrafting 1.12.2
=======================

This is an attempted port of CrayCrafting to 1.12.2. <br>
I am not the original developer, but you can view the original devs' website at [this link](http://doubledoordev.net/). <br>
CrayCrafting introduces more challenges to the game by switching recipes to other random ones every 10 minutes (by default). <br>
If you have a suggestion or a bug report, please make an issue and include the log and any other relevant information in the report (screenshots, what you were doing before the crash/bug, etc.). <br>
I'd love to update this mod and keep it alive as much as I can, but I have a life, too, and I can't make any promises on my ability to deliver updates. <br>
I'm also not that experienced in Java, so please bear with me while I try to port it to newer versions of Minecraft and maybe even add features. <br>
Once again, I can't promise that I'll be able to push out many updates. I'll try my best to keep CrayCrafting up-to-date, but I'm not going to allow this mod to get in the way of my life.
